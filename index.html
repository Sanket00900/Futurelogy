                Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language
                processing, speech recognition and machine vision.
                AI programming focuses on three cognitive skills: learning, reasoning and self-correction.

                Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system.
                A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain.

                The cloud is a virtual space that exists on the internet. It is a storage space where people can place their digital resources such as software, applications and files. So in
                simplified terms, we can say that the cloud is a virtual storage space on the internet.

                Nanotechnology is the understanding and control of matter at the nanoscale, at dimensions between approximately 1 and 100 nanometers, where unique phenomena enable novel applications.
                Encompassing nanoscale science, engineering, and technology, nanotechnology involves imaging, measuring, modeling, and manipulating matter at this length scale.

                Robotics, design, construction, and use of machines (robots) to perform tasks done traditionally by human beings. Robots are widely used in such industries as automobile manufacture to
                perform simple repetitive tasks, and in industries where work must be performed in environments hazardous to humans. Many aspects of robotics involve artificial intelligence; robots
                may be equipped with the equivalent of human senses such as vision, touch, and the ability to sense temperature.

                <br>
                Holography is a unique method of photography whereby 3D objects are recorded using a laser and then restored as precisely as possible to match the originally recorded object. When
                illuminated via a laser, holograms are able to form an exact 3D clone of the object and duplicate its features.
